## Running the Application and Features
### User Story
- This Application works with JSON data that has been created by the author and deployed remotely using https://json-server-vercel-zeta.vercel.app/bots as an API.
- The first thing you will notice when you load the page is a Bot Battlr app with all the neccesary details needed 
- The app allows you to choose your bot army in that when you click on a bot in the full bot collection you are interested in, you can add them to your own personal army.
- Clicking a  bot in your selected army will remove and bring it back to the full collection in case you are no longer interested in that particular bot.
- In case you want to delete a bot entirely in the bot collection,  you can click the red delete button and it will disappear completely.

# THERE YOU GO! YOU CAN NOW ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE APPLICATION. HAVE FUN!
